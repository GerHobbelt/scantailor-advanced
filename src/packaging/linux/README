We switched on building deb packets for Linux according to Ubuntu instructions.
In particular:
https://packaging.ubuntu.com/html/getting-set-up.html
https://packaging.ubuntu.com/html/packaging-new-software.html
 
Deb packets are supposed to be published on launchpad: https://launchpad.net/~truf/+archive/ubuntu/scantailor-universal
 
You can update your system with packages from this untrusted PPA by adding ppa:truf/scantailor-universal to your system's Software Sources:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:truf/scantailor-universal
sudo apt-get update

If you want to build deb packet by himself you may follow instructions.
I'm leaving some key steps here just as a reminder for myself:

bzr dh-make scantailor-universal 0.2.9 scantailor-universal-0.2.9.tar.gz
cd scantailor-universal/debian/
rm *.ex *.EX README.* *.docs
cd ..
bzr builddeb --  -us -uc 
bzr builddeb -S
cd ../build-area/
pbuilder-dist bionic build scantailor-universal_0.2.9-0ubuntu1.dsc
gpg --list-secret-keys
debsign -k 2B79FA6A519BF20289519BBCA2F3EBCE5C719A67 scantailor-universal_0.2.9-0ubuntu1_source.changes
dput  ppa:truf/scantailor-universal scantailor-universal_0.2.9-0ubuntu1_source.changes
